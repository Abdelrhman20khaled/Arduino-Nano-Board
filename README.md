## Overview

This project provides a complete guide to designing an Arduino Nano board, including the schematic, PCB layout, and Gerber files. 
It aims to help makers and developers understand the process of creating a custom Arduino Nano board, allowing them to customize or modify the design to suit their specific needs.

## Features

- **Complete Design Files**: Includes schematic, PCB layout, and Gerber files.
- **Customizable**: Modify the design to add new features or components.
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and distribute under the MIT License.

## Hardware Design

The hardware design files are provided in the `hardware/` directory. This includes:
- **Schematic**: The circuit diagram of the Arduino Nano board.
- **PCB Layout**: The layout of the printed circuit board.
- **Gerber Files**: The files needed for PCB fabrication.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the design files in your preferred PCB design software (e.g., KiCad, Eagle).

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Abdelrhman20khaled/Arduino-Nano-Board/tree/main]
